# Insurance Claim Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project builds a predictive model to estimate the probability of an
insurance claim for buildings based on structural and environmental features.

## About Project
You have been appointed as the Lead Data Analyst to build a predictive model to determine if a building will have an insurance claim during a certain period or not. You will have to predict the probability of having at least one claim over the insured period of the building. The model will be based on the building characteristics. The target variable, Claim, is a:

1 if the building has at least a claim over the insured period.<br>
0 if the building doesn’t have a claim over the insured period.

## Dataset
The dataset contains building characteristics and a binary target variable
indicating claim occurrence.
